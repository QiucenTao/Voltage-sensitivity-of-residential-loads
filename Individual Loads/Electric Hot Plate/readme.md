# Electric Hot Plate

The electric hot plate can be considered as a resister. Therefore, a constant Kpv value of 2 is observed. The reactive power consumption of the hot plate is lower than the minimum calculation power (20 Var, see the red dashed line) for good accuracy. Thus, the Kqv is not calculated and is neglected (set to 0).
