# Monitor
The power factor of the monitor is not controlled. It appears a non-sinusoidal current waveform, that contains a lot of harmonics. The reactive power is calculated using Q = \sqrt(S<sup>2</sup> - P<sup>2</sup>). Thus, the reactive power contains all the power which is not active power at the fundamental frequency. This results in a higher reactive power consumption in comparison to the active power.
